positive ,    The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council adjourned after presenting divergent producer and consumer views on buffer stock rules and agreeing to examine a draft compromise proposal on the buffer stock issue tomorrow, delegates said. ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn will draw up what some delegates called a "pre-compromise" and present it to the buffer stock working group at 1130 hrs GMT Tuesday, they said. While consumer and producer member nations disagree how a buffer stock should be implemented, both sides reiterated they were willing to compromise to come to agreement, they said. "I am optimistic we will be able to come to an agreement -- maybe not tomorrow or the next day, but some time later in the session," a consumer delegate said. Producers say they want the buffer stock to consist only of ICCO member cocoa, comprise a representative basket of various grade cocoas and pay different prices for different grades, delegates said. Some consumers would rather the buffer stock manager be able to buy non-member cocoa also, and pay a single price for the buffer stock cocoa without respect to origin. Consumer members were not unified in their views on how the buffer stock should operate, with several countries backing different aspects of the producer stance, delegates said. The semi-annual council meeting is scheduled to run until March 27. Consideration of the buffer stock rules is the most controversial topic on the agenda, delegates said.
positive ,    Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told Reuters. "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be actively depressing it," one company spokesman said. Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes. Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the 1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market. "Even before he started operations, traders estimated the manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level, and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said. "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply step back," he added. "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the market because everyone is holding back from both buying and selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one processor said. "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is about to alter his methods," he added. Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock buying for some time to come.
positive ,    Traders recently returned from West Africa say some producers there are dismayed by the ineffective action so far by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock manager on buffer stock purchases. One trader said some West African producers are annoyed the Buffer Stock manager is not playing his part as required by the International Cocoa Pact to stabilise prices from current lows. So far, only 21,000 tonnes of second hand cocoa have been taken up for buffer stock purposes and this, traders noted, only on an intermittent basis. They noted the purchases, of 8,000 tonnes in the first week he bought and 13,000 in the second, are well short of the limitations of no more than 5,000 tonnes in one day and 20,000 in one week which the cocoa agreement places on him. The traders recently returned from West Africa say producers there are unhappy about the impact on cocoa prices so far, noting producing countries are part of the international cocoa pact and deserve the same treatment as consumers. London traders say terminal market prices would have to gain around 300 stg a tonne to take the ICCO 10-day average indicator to its 1,935 sdr per tonne midway point (or reference price). However, little progress has been made in that direction, and the 10-day average is still well below the 1,600 sdr lower intervention level at 1,562.87 from 1,569.46 previously. The buffer stock manager may announce today he will be making purchases tomorrow, although under the rules of the agreement such action is not automatic, traders said. Complaints about the inaction of the buffer stock manager are not confined to West African producers, they observed. A Reuter report from Rotterdam quoted industry sources there saying Dutch cocoa processors also are unhappy with the intermittent buffer stock buying activities. In London, traders expressed surprise that no more than 21,000 tonnes cocoa has been bought so far against total potential purchases under the new agreement of 150,000 tonnes. Carryover holdings from the previous International Cocoa Agreement in the stock total 100,000 tonnes. Terminal prices today rose by up to 10 stg a tonne from Friday's close, basis July at its high of 1,271. It seems that when the buffer stock manager is absent from the market, prices go up, while when he declares his intention to buy, quite often the reverse applies, traders said.
positive ,    A senior Ivory Coast Agriculture Ministry official confirmed his country's backing for a new international cocoa pact and said Ivorian delegates would be present at talks on its buffer stock starting this week. The official told Reuters that Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon would attend the opening of the talks, convened by the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO), in London on Monday. While Bra Kanon is due to return home this week for funeral ceremonies for a sister of Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, scheduled to be held in the country's capital Yamoussoukro between March 19-22, senior Ivorian delegates will be present throughout the London talks, the official said. Bra Kanon is chairman of the ICCO Council and rumours that he or Ivorian delegates might be delayed because of public mourning in the West African nation helped depress already low world cocoa prices Friday. The official said Ivory Coast continued to support the new pact, which was agreed in principle last year by most of the world's cocoa exporters and consumers. He also said Bra Kanon would fulfil his duties as ICCO Council chairman during the talks, scheduled to end on March 27. The meeting aims to set rules for the operation of the pact's buffer stock which producers hope will boost a market hit by successive world cocoa surpluses. Ivory Coast did not participate in the last international cocoa pact and its decision to join the new accord has sparked hopes that it will be more successful in supporting prices.

positive ,    The credibility of government efforts to stabilise fluctuating commodity prices will again be put to the test over the next two weeks as countries try to agree on how a buffer stock should operate in the cocoa market, government delegates and trade experts said. Only two weeks ago, world coffee prices slumped when International Coffee Organization members failed to agree on how coffee export quotas should be calculated. This week, many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work. The still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the International Tin Council (ITC), which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling, is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations. The ITC's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built-in flaws or unlimited liability, but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade. A more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new International Natural Rubber Agreement in Geneva at the weekend. Some importing countries insist the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought. One consumer country delegate said this would "distort, not support" the market. Trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the ICCO for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder. On Friday this uncertainty helped push London cocoa futures down to eight month lows. The strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices. The ICCO daily and average prices on Friday fell below the "must buy" level of 1,600 SDRs a tonne designated in the pact, which came into force at the last ICCO session in January but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock. Consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given. The agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets. A cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100,000 tonnes of cocoa, enough to mount large buying or selling operations, were carried forward from the previous agreement. Members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade. It has an upper limit of 250,000 tonnes. The key arguments being faced by the ICCO working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non-member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa. Another working group is scheduled to meet Wednesday to discuss administrative matters, and the full council meets on Thursday. Producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non-member countries such as Malaysia. Consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium-priced high quality cocoas. The argument over buying non-member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities. European industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non-member cocoa and that it use the London futures market's existing differentials for different qualities. Currently, good West African cocoa is tendered at par onto the London market. Discounts, which are currently under review, range up to 50 stg a tonne for Brazilian and Malaysian cocoa. Consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high - the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand, forcing all prices lower. The January talks were slowed by a split inside the European Community, a key ICCO consumer group, with France siding with producers. EC representatives met in closed session in Brussels on Friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and, a diplomatic source said, narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations. The source said the EC will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there. One ICCO delegate describing the producer/consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is "meant to support the market where trade buying is not." In contrast, he said, producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers. Other, more technical, issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced "posted price" as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers. In either case, delegates said, it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers.
positive ,    Representatives of cocoa consuming countries at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting here have edged closer to a unified stance on buffer stock rules, delegates said. While consumers do not yet have a common position, an observer said after a consumer meeting, "They are much more fluid ... and the tone is positive." European Community consumers were split on the question of how the cocoa buffer stock should be operated when the ICCO met in January to put the new International Cocoa Agreement into effect, delegates said. At the January meeting, France sided with producers on how the buffer stock should operate, delegates said. That meeting ended without agreement on new buffer stock rules. The EC Commission met in Brussels on Friday to see whether the 12 EC cocoa consuming nations could narrow their differences at this month's meeting. The Commissioners came away from the Friday meeting with an informal agreement to respond to signs of flexibility among producers on the key buffer stock issues, delegates said. The key issues to be addressed at this council session which divide ICCO members are whether non-member cocoa should be eligible for buffer stock purchases and what price differentials the buffer stock should pay for different types of cocoa, delegates said. A consumer delegate said producers and consumers should be able to compromise on the non-member cocoa question. A working group comprising delegates from all producing and consuming member countries met briefly this morning, then broke up into a producer meeting and an EC meeting, followed by a consumer meeting. Producers, who are in favour of the buffer stock buying a variety of grades of cocoa and oppose non-member cocoa being accepted, reviewed their position ahead of the working group meeting this afternoon. "We are waiting to see what consumers say," a producer delegate said. "We hope they will be flexible or it will be difficult to negotiate." The ICCO comprises 33 member countries. Non- members include the U.S., a consumer, and Malaysia, an increasingly important producer.
positive ,    Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review. The dry period means the temporao will be late this year. Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures. Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors. There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates. In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment. Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos. Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named. New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB. Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs. April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports. Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec. Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas. Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said. Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop. Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.
positive ,    Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said. Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa market support mechanism were improving. "The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock rules by the end of next week," Ghanaian delegate and producer spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists. Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the negotiations "optimistic and realistic." The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January, with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250 mln dlrs. The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in world cocoa prices. Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles as a basis for negotiations. The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates said. Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet separately later today to examine the scheme. The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates said. During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast delegation gave "an open minded statement" that it is willing to work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into effect as soon as possible, Baron said. Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place. Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council session because of a conflicting International Sugar Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon, delegates said.
positive ,    A final compromise proposal on cocoa buffer stock rules presented by International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, council chairman Denis Bra Kanon is swiftly gaining acceptance by consumer and producer members, delegates said. "We are close, nearer than ever to accepting it, but we still have some work to do," producer spokesman Mama Mohammed of Ghana told Reuters after a producers' meeting. European Community, EC, delegates said EC consumers accepted the package in a morning meeting and predicted "no problems" in getting full consumer acceptance. Delegates on both sides are keen to come to some agreement today, the last day of the fortnight-long council meeting, they said. The compromise requires that buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries cannot exceed 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases, delegates said. The non-member cocoa issue has been among the most contentious in the rules negotiations. The 15 pct figure, up five percentage points from earlier proposals, represents a concession to consumers, delegates said. They have demanded a larger allowance for non-member cocoa in the buffer stock than producers have wanted. Another problem area, delegates said, was the question of price differentials for different origins of cocoa bought into the buffer stock, by which the buffer stock manager could fairly compare relative prices of different cocoas offered to him. The compromise narrowed the range of differentials between the origins from what previous proposals had detailed -- a move some delegates described as "just fiddling." But the adjustments may prove significant enough to appease some countries that were not satisfied with the original proposed differentials assigned to them, delegates said. The compromise also stated buffer stock purchases on any day would be limited to 40 pct each in nearby, intermediate or forward positions, delegates said. If the compromise is accepted by the council, most consumers and producers want buffer stock rules to take effect next week, or as soon as practically possible. The full council is scheduled to meet around 1500 GMT to discuss the compromise, and could agree on it then if all parties are satisfied, they said. Consumers are due to meet before the council.
positive ,    Leading cocoa producers will discuss whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices when they start four day's of talks here later today, conference sources said. Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance (CPA) is the pact's second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices. The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June, and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue, the sources said. Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an international cocoa research conference due to take place in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month, CPA secretary general D.S. Kamga said. The 11-member CPA include the world's top three producers of Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct of world output.
positive ,    The International Cocoa Organization, ICCO, buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon, delegates said. The plan, presented by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, represented a compromise between producer, European Community, EC, and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate, they said. The proposal involved three key principles. First, the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously, delegates said. Under an offer system, the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices, they said. The second provision was that non-ICCO member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock, while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa, to be set by a formula, the delegates said. After the plan was presented, working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers, EC consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal. Producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 GMT, producer delegates said. Consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from, one consumer delegate said. Delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change.
positive ,    New Zealand's inflation and interest rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said. The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December. Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter. The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87. The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to change, it said. Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in calendar 1986, it said. "Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls away," the NZIER said. Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct. Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct. The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4. "A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast," the NZIER said. "The current account deficit is expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in 1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88." The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32 billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and 3.33 billion in 1985/86. The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87 billion in 1985/86. This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion. "Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation ...," the NZIER said. "Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand economy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well for future prospects."
positive ,    International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) producers and consumers accepted the principles of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation, delegates said. The buffer stock working group then asked ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn, who wrote up the draft compromise, to flesh out details of the principles with the assistance of a representative group of delegates, they said. The working group broke up for the day, into a smaller group of five producers and five consumers to discuss administrative rules and into the group headed by Erbynn to hammer out buffer stock rules details, delegates said. Delegates said many differences of opinion still have to be ironed out. "Whenever we start getting into details the clouds gather," one delegate said. Erbynn is likely to present fleshed out details of the buffer stock rules proposal to the working group early tomorrow, delegates said. The principles of the draft proposal included establishing an offer system for buffer stock purchases rather than a posted price system, a limit to the amount of non-ICCO member cocoa that can be bought, and differentials to be paid for different varieties of cocoa comprising the buffer stock, delegates said.
positive ,    New York cocoa traders reacted with caution to today's developments at the International Cocoa Organization talks in London, saying there is still time for negotiations to break down. "I would be extremely cautious to go either long or short at this point," said Jack Ward, president of the cocoa trading firm Barretto Peat. "If and when a final position comes out (of the ICCO talks) one will still have time to put on positions. The risk at the moment is not commensurate with the possible gain." ICCO producer and consumer delegates this morning accepted the outlines of a compromise proposal on buffer stock rules as a basis for further negotiation. A smaller group of representatives is now charged with fleshing out the details. "Market sentiment has reflected optimism, I would't put it any stronger than that," Ward said. "It seems to put them slightly closer to an agreement... but one shouldn't forget how much they have to negotiate," said another trader of today's developments. Many dealers were sidelined coming into the negotiations and have remained so, traders said. "The dealers have got historically small positions in outright terms," one trader said. Speculators have gone net long "but only slightly so," he added. The recent price strength -- gains of about 52 dlrs the last two days -- has been due in large part to sterling's rally against the dollar and in the process has attracted a measure of origin selling, traders said.
negative ,    The Bremen green coffee market attracted good buying interest for Colombian coffee last week, while Brazils were almost neglected, trade sources said. Buyers were awaiting the opening of Brazil's export registrations for May shipment, which could affect prices for similar qualities, they said. Colombia opened export registrations and good business developed with both the FNC and private shippers. Prices were said to have been very attractive, but details were not immediately available. Central Americans were sought for spot and afloat. In the robusta sector nearby material was rather scarce, with turnover limited, the sources said. The following offers were in the market at the end of last week, first or second hand, sellers' ideas for spot, afloat or prompt shipment in dlrs per 50 kilos fob equivalent, unless stated (previous week's prices in brackets) - Brazil unwashed German quals 100 (102), Colombia Excelso 105 (110), Salvador SHG 110 (108), Nicaragua SHG 109 (same), Guatemala HB 111 (same), Costa Rica SHB 113 (112), Kenya AB FAQ 142 (134), Tanzania AB FAQ 120 (same), Zaire K-5 105 (unq), Sumatra robusta EK-1 91 CIF (same).
negative ,    Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said. The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said. The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda's total exports. The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga. These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports. Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks. However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh delays in cargo movements. Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs. Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags. These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September) crop, the sources said. According to the sources, the board's financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts. The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process, they said. The sources said the CMB's price structure had been overtaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears. "The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole," one of the sources said. The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political strife.
negative ,    The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee "C" contracts to 6.0 cents a lb, from the previous 4.0 cents, effective today, the CSCE said. The new daily limits apply to all but the two nearby positions, currently May and July, which trade without limits. In addition, the 6.0 cent limit can be increased to 9.0 cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions, according to the CSCE announcement. Before the rule change today, the CSCE required two days of limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before expanding the daily trading limit. Under new guidelines, if the first two restricted deliveries move the 6.0 cent limit for two days the Exchange will expand the limit. The expanded 9.0 cent limit will remain in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 cent limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions, the CSCE said.
negative ,    Singapore's United Industrial Corp Ltd (UIC) has agreed in principle to inject 16 mln dlrs in convertible loan stock into Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd, a creditor bank official said. UIC is likely to take a controlling stake in the troubled international coffee trading firm, but plans are not finalised and negotiations will continue for another two weeks, he said. Teck Hock's nine creditor banks have agreed to extend the company's loan repayment period for 10 years although a percentage of the new capital injection will be used to pay off part of the debt. Teck Hock owes more than 100 mln Singapore dlrs and since last December the banks have been allowing the company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an investor. The nine banks are Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd, United Overseas Bank Ltd, Banque Paribas, Bangkok Bank Ltd, Citibank N.A., Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, Algemene Bank Nederland NV, Banque Nationale de Paris and Chase Manhattan Bank NA.
negative ,    Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's coffee growers' federation, said he did not believe any important decisions would emerge from an upcoming meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO). The ICO executive board is set to meet in London from March 31 and could decide to call a special council session by the end of April to discuss export quotas. "It's going to be a routine meeting, an update of what has been happening in the market, but it's unlikely any major decisions are taken," Cardenas told journalists. Earlier this month, talks in London to re-introduce export quotas, suspended in February 1986, ended in failure. Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria, also talking to reporters at the end of the weekly National Coffee Committee meeting, said the positions of Brazil and of the United States were too far apart to allow a prompt agreement on quotas. Brazil's coffee chief Jorio Dauster said yesterday Brazil would not change its coffee policies. Cardenas said the market situation was getting clearer because the trade knew the projected output and stockpile levels of producers. He said according to ICO statistics there was a shortfall of nine mln (60-kg) bags on the world market between October, the start of the coffee year, and February.
negative ,    Chances that the International Coffee Organization, ICO, executive board meeting this week will agree to resume negotiations on export quotas soon look remote, ICO delegates and trade sources said. ICO observers doubted Brazil or key consuming countries are ready to give sufficient ground to convince the other side that reopening negotiations again would be worthwhile, they said. ICO talks on quotas last month broke down after eight days when producers and consumers failed to reach agreement. "Since we have not seen signs of change in other positions, it's difficult to see a positive outcome at this stage," Brazilian delegate Lindenberg Sette said. But quotas must be negotiated sometime, he said. The U.S. has indicated it is open to dialogue on quotas but that Brazil must be flexible, rather than refuse to lower its export share as it did in the last negotiations, delegates said. At this week's March 31-April 2 meeting, the 16-member ICO board is scheduled to discuss the current market situation, the reintroduction of quotas, verification of stocks and some administrative matters, according to a draft agenda. The fact that Brazilian Coffee Institute president Jorio Dauster, Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Jon Rosenbaum and chief Colombian delegate Jorge Cardenas are not attending the meeting has signalled to most market watchers that it will be a non-event as far as negotiating quotas is concerned. "I would imagine there will be a lot of politicking among producers behind closed doors to work up some kind of proposal by September (the next scheduled council meeting)," Bronwyn Curtis of Landell Mills Commodities Studies said. Traders and delegates said they have seen no sign that a date will be set for an earlier council meeting. If the stalemate continues much longer, analysts expect the coffee agreement will end up operating without quotas for the remainder of its life, to September 30, 1989. When talks broke down, the U.S. and Brazil, the largest coffee consumer and producer respectively, blamed one another for sabotaging negotiations by refusing to compromise. Brazil wanted to maintain the previous export quota shares, under which it was allocated 30 pct of world coffee exports, but consumers and a small group of producers pressed for shares to be redistributed using "objective criteria," which would have threatened Brazil's share. At a recent meeting in Managua of Latin American producers, Costa Rica and Honduras said they were willing to put their objections as members of the group of eight ICO "dissident" producers aside, in order to stem the damaging decline in prices, Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca told reporters Saturday. He was in London to brief producers on the Managua meeting. However, other producers said they were not aware of this move toward producer solidarity. London coffee prices closed at 1,276 stg a tonne today, down from around 1,550 at the beginning of March.
negative ,    An 11-day-old strike by Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said. They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike. A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source added. By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped, the sources said. Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.
negative ,    Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum. The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices. However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight. World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds. Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter. Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said. Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate. The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said. The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said. Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters. But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics. Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later. Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said. Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said. If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said. Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.
negative ,    The failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said. Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said. A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said. Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil. With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted. Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said. The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks. Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria. "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO." Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them." Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme. But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct. Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it. A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together. Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings. Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said. The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast. The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until September, delegates said.
negative ,    This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said. "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said. "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said. "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added. Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis. "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said. "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation," de Vries added. With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.
negative ,    Private coffee exporters say Colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions. Gilberto Arango, president of the exporters' association, said in an interview that Colombia, the world's second largest producer, was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of International Coffee Organization (ICO) export quotas. "Colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation," he said. Recent ICO talks in London failed to break a deadlock over re-introduction of export quotas, suspended in February 1986, and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue. Arango said that government measures adopted here last week, including a lower export registration price, indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism. "This is the start of a new era in Colombia because world market conditions are also new," he said. The government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price, or reintegro, will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends. Arango said an illustration of Colombia's new attitude was the decision on Friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount. But he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee. "Our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently. No targets for volume will be set. We will react to market factors adequately and Colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away." Colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports, he said. "We will certainly not export seven mln (60-kilo) bags but neither are we going to sell like mad. The trade knows full well what Colombia's export potential is," he said. Colombia, with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year which ended last September, and 11.3 mln in calendar 1986. Arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986/87 coffee year would not exceed 10.5 mln bags, compared with 12 mln forecast by the National Coffee Growers' Federation and 12.5 mln by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, a figure he said was "ridiculous." He said ageing plantations and rust, in particular in the number one producing province of Antioquia, meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9.5 mln and 11.5 mln bags. On the failure of the recent ICO talks, Arango said Colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise. Jorge Cardenas, manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in London, has blamed the intransigence of some big countries, without naming them. However, Arango, like Colombian Finance Minister Cesar Gaviria last week, was more explicit and said the United States would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy. "Washington will have to take into account that for many countries, and some of its allies for instance in Central America, a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far-reaching political and economic consequences." Arango ruled out a fresh Colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts.
negative ,    Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said. Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices. An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil. Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet. However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop. Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years. Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries. It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said. "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein," Cardenas said.
negative ,    Recent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative groups said. Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports, told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986. A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected. Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation. Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts. He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO. He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members.
negative ,    Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said. The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close. The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb. Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said. The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop. In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it is time to go and sell coffee." But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year. A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months. The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said. All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO. Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings. It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said. Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise. Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them. "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said. Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed. The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September. More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980. A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability. In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found. "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said.
negative ,    Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas. "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London. Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible. In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries. He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less. According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue. That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986. Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.
negative ,    Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long. Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions. "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks. Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982. Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues. He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month. Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks. "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said without elaborating. "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market," he said. Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season. Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo. Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation. A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future" despite the commodities price slide. The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers. Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee. Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.
